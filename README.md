# Hi, I'am Ronee and this is my Personal Website 

### Portfolio

I am an Indian citizen and speak English, Hindi, and Assamese (native).

Since I began my professional journey Iâ€™ve been lucky to have had the opportunity to collaborate on some exciting solo and collaborative projects. With work experience as a seasoned Internal Product Manager with hands-on experience in Engineering, I come from a cross-functional background and truly value the multidisciplinary nature of good product quality. Hyper-focused on establishing a highly personalized experience for a user, I believe I can be an asset to the team with the common goal of creating a user journey for everyone.
